# ExtractPowerPivot
PowerPivot Extraction Tool

Sample PowerPivot data used in the xlsm file can be found here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102

Will be fixed in the future (i.e. probably never):

1. no 30 second wait, find a more clever way
2. open pre2008 model in 2013
3. "Open Excel2013zip For Binary Lock Read Write As #1"
4. What if the extension is not XLSX?
5. "not files - weird error(PP)" (whatever this was supposed to mean when I wrote it)
